# RootMeBot

## Add it to your discord server

~~Follow [this link](https://http.cat/410)~~ Link removed, but you can still host your own instance of the bot!

## Self deployment

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

It is not possible to mount a VOLUME with Dockerfile specifying both source and destination, so i choose to use docker-compose to make it possible.
